		<!-- {{ templates }} work like EJS: 
			anything between the braces is rendered,
			be it a method return or a property

			but only if the rendered thing can be output in the DOM
			so basically returned strings
		-->
		<!-- v-once: directive that only changes an element's child props once 
			if they would be changed multiple times 
		-->
		<h1 v-once>{{ title }}</h1>
		<p>{{ sayHello() }} -

			<!-- VueJS doesn't mess with your native HTML attributes,
				like below:
				<a href="{{ link }}"></a>
				
				so you need VueJS attributes to have VueJS manipulate,
				aka directives

				v-bind is a directive that binds a value to the element,
				which allows you to pass in Vue data directly, no {{}}
			-->
			<a v-bind:href="link"></a>
			<!-- Like EJS, VueJS escapes HTML on render
				Once you've sanitized, making sure the HTML is safe to inject,
				you can inject the HTML into an element using v-html

				think of it as <%= %> in EJS, but thrown into the element
				on which the directive lives, as opposed to just being thrown
				into the DOM as in Twine games
